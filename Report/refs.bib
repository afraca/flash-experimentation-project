abstract = {The last fifteen years have transformed the Web in ways that would seem unimaginable to anyone of the "few" Internet users of the year 1995 [8]. What began as a simple set of protocols and mechanisms facilitating the exchange of static documents between remote computers is now an everyday part of billions' of users life, technical and non-technical alike. The sum of a user's daily experience is composed of open standards, such as HTML, JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets as well as proprietary plugins, such as Adobe's Flash [1] and Microsoft's Silverlight [6].},
